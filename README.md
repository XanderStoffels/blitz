# Blitz

Blitz is an experimental HTTP web server. I started this project to learn more about how to write performant code in C#.
Another goal for this project is to not use any external libraries, except for the .NET Core runtime and some of the 
Microsoft.Extensions.* libraries in order to fit into the Microsoft eco system.

## How to run
Make sure you have at least the .NET 8 SDK installed.
Simply navigate into the Blitz.CLI folder and run `dotnet run`.
